The focal point of this analysis is a medical insurance dataset, provided by Codecademy. This document is structured into several key sections, beginning with a detailed descriptive analysis, followed by an in-depth exploratory analysis. To enable the formulation of accurate future charge predictions, a regression model has been developed. This model is specifically designed to generate reliable predictions based on new data inputs.
