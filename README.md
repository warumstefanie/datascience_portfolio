## 1. Analysis US Medical Insurance Costs
The focal point of this analysis is a medical insurance dataset, provided by Codecademy. This document is structured into several key sections, beginning with a detailed descriptive analysis, followed by an in-depth exploratory analysis. To enable the formulation of accurate future charge predictions, a regression model has been developed. This model is specifically designed to generate reliable predictions based on new data inputs.

## 2. Hurricane Analysis
This is a led manipulation and analysis of the hurricane dataset provided by Codecademy. The main focus of the project included a preparation of the data as dictionaries and the subsequent handling of the dictionaries. 

## 3. This is Jeopardy!
Codecademy project with open-ended requirements. I to wrote several functions that investigate a dataset of Jeopardy! questions and answers. I filtered the dataset for topics that I was interested in, computed the average difficulty of those questions.

## 4. EDA: Diagnosing Diabetes
In this project, I looked at how certain diagnostic factors affect the diabetes outcome of women patients. I used my EDA skills to help inspect, clean, and validate the data.
